Come on. Car's packed. We gotta get out of here.

00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,365
We're friends, right?

525

We tell each other things, trust each other.

526
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,769
Caroline, it's not because I didn't trust you.

527
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,368
It's just that you trust Elena more. I get it. Of course you would.

528
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,569
Still sucks to be left out of the loop, you know?

529
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,211
If it makes you feel any better, there are things I tell you that I don't tell her.

And, look, maybe I didn't want you to know that I killed Enzo.

533
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,890
- Why? - Because I know you...

534
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,880
and I know you guys had that weird little chemistry thing going on.

535
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,488
Oh, please. You're delusional.

536
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,564

I'll, uh, meet you over by the car when you're done.

00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,449
- Hey. - Hey, we're leaving. Pack your stuff.

540
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,124
I will. I just came out to see how you were doing.

541
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,847
I'm in a hurry. You should be too. The Travelers can find us.

542
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:53,684
- So that's it? We're not gonna talk about this? - What's there to talk about?

543
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,963
- I'm sorry that I lied to you. - I don't care that you lied. Really.

544
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,328
Okay, I'm confused. Why are you being like this?

545
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,091
Because you were right, Elena.

546
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,527
You wanted to protect me so I wouldn't spiral.

547
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:13,566
Because if I spiraled, then it would prove that we shouldn't be together.

548
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,805
But I didn't spiral.

549

Despite every nerve in my body wanting to break something or hurt someone...

550
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,041
or do all the wrong things for all the right reasons...

551
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,561
I'm holding it together the best I can...

552
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,162
for you.

553
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,844
- But you're still mad at me. - Of course I'm still mad at you.

554
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,691
Because being around you drives me nuts.

555
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,204
And not being around you drives me nuts.

556
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,888
Okay, now I'm really confused.

557
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,963
What was that for?

558
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:21,644
Because I've had a really crappy day.

00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,885
